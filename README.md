# Better Wordle

## Description

This is an implementation of the popular word-guessing game Wordle with my own twist.

## Objective

Wordle is a popular word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by making guesses and receiving feedback on their guesses.  
The game provides clues in the form of colored squares, indicating whether a guessed letter is correct and in the correct position (usually marked with a green square) or correct but in the wrong position (usually marked with a yellow square).  
The objective is to guess the word within a limited number of  attempts.

## Features

All the normal Wordle features and rules are present, with the following additional features:

- Clicking on a box will highlight it and pressing a key will fill the highlighted box with the corresponding letter.
- Pressing the Backspace key will clear the highlighted box.
- Pressing left or right arrow keys will move the highlight left or right.
- Pressing the Escape key will clear the selection.
